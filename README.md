Learn to code by editing a web site. 

## Steps

1. Sign up for a GitHub account.
2. Fork the repo. 
3. Edit your page in a web browser.
4. Save your changes and commit your work. 
5. Create a pull request.

I'll pull in your work to the main version and GitHub will regenerate the site with your new information.
